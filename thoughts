for attack can do like
for (int i = STEP; i <= END; i += STEP) {
  System.out.println(STEP, ", ", STEP / END, ", ");
}
into an envelope array.


to play with effects need to have a way to know which instruments have effects,
maybe make a class Instrument that knows its sample and whatever effect is
attached to it?

OR create a function for each effect or find a unitgen idk and do like the
sonic pi backend and do something like each time a sample needs to play with an
effect, connect it to a function player or something

maybe could have like an addTrack method to the backend and it accepts a
function unitgen as optional argument, so when it's there put it inbetween so
it goes something like addTrack(new int [] %pattern%, %effect%). then i'd need
to use the separate tracks for that. ask teacher about this
